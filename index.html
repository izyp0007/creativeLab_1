	<h1>The world of climbing</h1>
	<p>Hey ya'll!! I picked climbing up as a hobby over the summer. And it is growing on me. Here is a run down of the rules, the ranking and jump to my portfolio to see some of the pictures I have taken.</p>
<hr></hr>
	<h3>Outside</h3>
	<p>With all sports there are skills that come with time. But the rules are simple. You tie yourself up and climb! There are certain moves and forms that are better but if you're like me first you just get used to the rope. </p>
<p>Outside climbs are ranked in the 5s. So 5.5 is steep enough to be tied in, but really isn't much. Once you hit 5.12 you are beyound habby. I would sya a good 5.7 is a great spot to start. When the snow hit I was working on a 5.9.
	</p>
<hr></hr>
	<h3>Inside</h3>
	<p>When you climb in a gym the point is the same, but each gym may have specific rules. Learn them! The other thing is when you're climbing in the gym each climb is indicated by color "rocks". This shows you a path but also restricts you to that path. 
	</p>

	<h3>Bouldering</h3>
	<p>Bouldering is also a part of climbing. When you boulder you climb with out a rope, but you do not climb high. It really is a different kind of climbing. But where I started with climbing I enjoy it over bouldering ;)
